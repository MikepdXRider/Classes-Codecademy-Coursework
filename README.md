## What I learned: 
* Classes are templates for objects.
* Javascript calls a constructor method when we create a new instance of a class.
* Inheritance is when we create a parent class with properties and methods that we can extend to child classes.
* We use the extends keyword to create a subclass.
* The super keyword calls the constructor() of a parent class.
* Static methods are called on the class, but not on instances of the class.
